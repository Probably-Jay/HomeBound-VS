[RALEIGH]: I guess...thats it...I have no family anymore. Nowhere to call home. I'm alone.
[IRIS]: I...there are no words right now that are the right words to help you through this.
[IRIS]: My, well my family and I, have space for you with us. It's safe and warm, and most importantly, you won't have to fake being you. We will only ever show you love.
[IRIS]: They came here with me. You've met Rex, would you like to meet the others?
[RALEIGH]: I dunno if right now is the best time, I'm not exactly in a great place.
[IRIS]: Oh I know that dear, and don't worry, they have gone through things themselves. They didn't have a group like them to support them. You do.
[IRIS]: I promise you, they won't judge you for who you are or what you've gone through.
[RALEIGH]: ...Yeah, I don't know where to go from here. I guess meeting your 'family' is as good a place to start as any.
[REX]: You've got us for as long as ya need kid.
[REX]: [i]Slaps Raleigh on the shoulder[_i] Lets go [colour: #f2ff00]Meet the Troops[colour: FFFFFF] kid.
[RALEIGH]: ...ow...
