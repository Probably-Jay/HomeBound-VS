[IRIS]: Hello Ma'am. Can I ask, does Raleigh live here? We're their friends.
[MUM]: I know all of Raleighs friends, you aren't his friends. I'd remember two like you...
[IRIS]: Aahhhh...yes...Well we know Raleigh from online. [i]they[_i], met me a little while ago. Can I speak to Raleigh? You can tell them it's Iris.
[MUM]: No you can't talk to him. He doesn't know you two. He doesn't need friends like you making this nonsense worse.
[IRIS]: Non...Non-sense?...I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.
[MUM]: It doesn't matter. My husband and I are going to deal with Raleigh. We're his parents. We know what's best for him.
[IRIS]: Please, I just want to talk to Raleigh. It won't take long and then we'll leave but I don't feel comfortable leaving without at least saying hello, you know?
[REX]: Seriously, we aren't leaving til we see them.
[REX]: Either you let us talk to them and we leave or I'm going to stand here and sing Rick Astley loudly and proudly
[REX]: What do you think Iris? Shall I? [i]deep breath in[_i]
[MUM]: Oh for god's sake! You're both ridiculous! Just... go ahead [b]quiety[_b] and stop being so ridiculous. Be quick, Raleigh needs to pack...[CompleteTask: mq_ttrm]
[MUM]: They're in their bedroom in the back.
