[RALEIGH]: Iris? Wow, you've come to Forest Hill.
[IRIS]: Yeah Raleigh, I've come to visit. First let me introduce Rex, their one of my dearest friends are roommate.
[REX]: Whats up kid.
[IRIS]: Anyway, I'm not here as a tourist. Raleigh, I need to make sure you're okay. The last conversations we had were...worrying.
[RALEIGH]: Yeah, listen Iris, everything is fine, I...Mum and Dad have found me some...well they know a good school that might...
[IRIS]: Raleigh, its okay, you can talk to me.
[RALEIGH]: [i] quietly, so nobody else could here[_i] I tried to talk to them, I tried to explain to them, I tried to tell them, that I'm not...I'm not...
[REX]: Okay, breathe kid, breathe...what did you try to tell them?
[RALEIGH]: I tried...I tried to tell them I'm non-binary. I don't feel like a guy, I don't feel anything like a guy, but not a woman either, just, I feel like I'm something...different.
[REX]: Welcome to the no beanie club kid, we have t-shirts.
[IRIS]: Rex! No jokes! Okay, Raleigh, I understand, we've all been through that conversation with parents, it didn't go well?
[RALEIGH]: And some...tomorrow they are taking me to the bus station in the next town over, they are sending me to this school that helps...'lost souls'.
[IRIS]: Do you want to go? Do you think you're 'lost'?
[RALEIGH]: ...I...They are my parents, they want whats best for me.
[IRIS]: [i]tearing up[_i] Oh, no darling...Rex, can you...?
[REX]: Yeah, Kid, parents often mean well but they aren't you, they can't feel how you feel or go through what you're going through.
[REX]: They may mean no harm, but they might not know whats best. They can't understand you entirely, doubly so when you aren't understanding you entirely.
[IRIS]: Raleigh, be honest with us, if you want to go then we'll leave and wish you well, if not...well we can try to help.
[RALEIGH]: Iris...I...I don't want to go. I don't want them to send me away. Iris...I'm scared.
[IRIS]: [i]tears beading up on her cheeks[_i] Oh darling, I know, we're here for you.
[REX]: [i]stroppy[_i] Ris, quit calling them darling. I'm 'darling' - They are 'kid'.
[IRIS]: [i]tearing up ends quickly, turning to a stern expression[_i] Oh shut it Rex. How can you be so helpful and yet, a collasal pain in the...
[REX]: [i]interupting Iris[_i] Right kid! You need to stand up for yourself. We can be here for you but we can't this conversation for you.
[IRIS]: We'll be right here with you, right by your side.[CompleteTask: mq_ttr]
