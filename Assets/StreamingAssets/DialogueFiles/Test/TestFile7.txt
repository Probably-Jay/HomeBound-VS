[Stranger]: Hello there.
[Player]: Hi?
[Stranger]: My name is [pause: 64][colour: FF00FF]REX.[colour: FFFFFF]
[Player]: Hello [colour: FF00FF]Rex[colour: FFFFFF], where am I?
[REX]: You're in the [colour: FF0000]HomeBound Tech Demo![colour: FFFFFF]
[REX]: You've already figured out [colour: 00FF00]Walking around[colour: FFFFFF] and [colour: 00FF00] interacting[colour: FFFFFF] with things, right?
[Player]: Yeah, I seem to be getting the hang of that!
[REX]: And you've totally got [colour: 00FF00]talking[colour: FFFFFF] down too.
[REX]: The last thing to try out is the [colour: FF00FF]RHYTHM ENCOUNTER!![colour: FFFFFF]
[Player]: What's that?
[REX]: Sometimes in this game, a conversation will become quite heated...
[REX]: In those situations, it can get pretty hard to get all your words out in the right order. 
[REX]: Let me show you what I mean...[pause: 64] [rythm: demo]
[REX]: I hope you're having fun... 
[REX]: Now, that wasn't so bad huh?
[Player]: I guess not...
[REX]: That's it from the [colour: FF0000]HomeBound Tech Demo Update![colour: FFFFFF]
[REX]: Hope to see you all soon!!
